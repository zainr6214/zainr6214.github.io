              This image is the screen shot for my game project its called rock paper scissors

              I created this screen shot by using the url of images found on google and putting 

              them into the bitmap function . This allowed me to define images as either the player

              background, target or the danger and with positioning i can place any other sprite 

              on the background image. I got the image on to git hub by saving image, creating an

              image directory with a place holder and uploading said image into the image directory.
 
              After the image is uploaded we use the images file name and put it into the template 

              mr allata gave us.
