Mid term question review

Some more information on this question was that 56

percent of everyone who took this answere chose moon weight and got the 

correect answer. This tells me that a majoraty knew the answer and that

the question was not that difficult.About 23 percent of people chose earth

weight being the second highest choice.I believe that this question is a novis level question 

becuase all we had to do was name the data given and we made no contract of our own .


(this part is not as important)


The mid term question that i chose to review is question 13 version 2 but on 

the original test booklet the number would be number 20 . On this specific question

they asked what would be an appropriate name for the number data that would be 

divided by six becuase that would be their moon weight. There were four anser choices wich 

included earth-weight,moon-weight and two other options that could be crossed 

out almost immediately . I crossed them out because the had no relation to the 

contract that i could see so it left me wih the two choices earth-weight and 

moon-weight.The correct answere for this question was earth weight becuase the

data that would be defined was their weight before division therefore on earth.

This question helped me understand that defintions that dont have anything to do 
 
with the data or value dont make sense and finally it made me understand the value

of reading a question carfully.
