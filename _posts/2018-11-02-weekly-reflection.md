            learning blog 7
             
             This is my 7th learning blog and thius week in my computer science class my learnign was centered around 
             
             classifacation of the many different parts of a contract and a function.This weeks class added to my
             
             understanding of strings names and how they translate from contracts to applications . An example is 
             
             how in a applacation we would write the color of a shape  we wanted it to be like "blue" and that would
             
             be considered a string but in the contract its written as just "string" so it could have a maney meaning to it.
             
             We were also given a worksheet that could test our understanding of wich applacation can have the same meaning as 
              
             another contract. Over all the the main idea of this week would be that understanding how contractas translate is very 
             
             important and usefull.
