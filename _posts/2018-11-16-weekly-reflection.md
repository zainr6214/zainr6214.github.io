 This weeks blog reflection i will talk about how to design a function
 
contract example
 ```;gt:number--->image```
 
 That contract is a discription of a function and it can apply to many
 
 different functions when you use an example. an example tells about the 
 
 functions that could fit the disctriptions for example telling the computer
 
 (example(triangle 100 "solid" "green")) as well as several other green solid
 
 trianlges of various sizes then you simply tell the computer gt and the size
 
 you want the triangle to be. A defintion can take this even further becuase if
 
 you define a specific example that you consider big as big gt when you type that
 
 into the computer and obtain a trianlge of that size. Together all of these help
 
 us better use a function
