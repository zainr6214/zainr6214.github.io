This week we learned about functions and values. Functions and values allow
you to make shapes add numbers together and many other things. we also learned
how the computer expects certin things and gives certin things. if i give the
computer  this (square 50 "outline" blue" 0 it will give me a blue square this 
is called a contract as long as i give the computer the correct cod it can give
me anything like a shape a number or a program. However if you give the computer 
somthing incorrect that it cannot understand you wont get anthing. for example
spelling any word wrong or using an undined shape the computer wont understand.
