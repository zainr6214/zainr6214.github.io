 This week we learned about functions and values. Functions and values allow you to make shapes add numbers together and many other things. we also learned how the computer expects certin things and gives certin things. if i give the computer  this (square 50 "outline" blue" 0 it will give me a blue square this is called a contract as long as i give the computer the correct cod it can give me anything like a shape a number or a program. However if you give the computer somthing incorrect that it cannot understand you wont get anthing. for example spelling any word wrong or using an undined shape the computer wont understand.
