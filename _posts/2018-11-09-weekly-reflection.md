This week is all about undertanding functions and how examples 

and contracts help us under stand functions. A function is an 

expression and it has many different parts to it. A contract

shows us the name of every part that the function contains

for example the range is what you get when you give a computer 

somthing that it can read and its called data and data can (amoung 

other things) can be images and numbers . An example 

shows the type of expression that can fit a function for example in

algebra an x can mean any number and in com0pute science (with limits)

the same applys .
