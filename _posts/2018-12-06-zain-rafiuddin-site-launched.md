 Part 1 flag geomatry
 
 This flag project required us to make a flag with specific geomatry that was as accurate as we could make it. Finding correct geomatry  was dependant of the amount of stripes each if each stripe was 1 cm the the hoist was 9 cm becuase there were 9 stripes.The canton (square on the top left corner) was the hieght if 5 stripes so the hieght was 5 cm .The canton took up one third of the fly(width) and being a square meant all sides were equal to 5 cm so i could tell the flags width or fly was 15 cm.  So finally the flags statistics are 9 cm tall and 15 cm long the canton is 5cm width and hight and each stripe is 1 cm
