       this post is actualy for the dat 2018-9-21 but i dident
    get to write it on time. this week we learned more about 
    tags and what they mean.each tag is an abreveation and
    makes the computer do different things.
    
    i struggled with remembering what each tag means and even 
    though writing it down helps i cant write very fast the new 
    website w3schools actualy has an arvchive of tags and there
    deffinitions this coiuld be very helpfull when we get to make
    our game
